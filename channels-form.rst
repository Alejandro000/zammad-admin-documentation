Forms
*****

With form you can add a form to your web page which directly generates a ticket for you.
**Please note:** At the moment it is not possible to add more (or custom) fields to a Zammad Form. 

You can set the following things for this form:

* the group the form submits the message to
* title of the form
* Name of the forms submit button
* The message being displayed after submitting the form
* you also have further options:
   * enabling debugging mode for implementation
   * enable displaying the forms title when being opened
   * the option to directly display the form or after a button being pressed ("Start modal dialog for form")
   * disable loading CSS for the form (handy if you want to integrate the CSS information within your stylesheet)
   * Add a new field for uploading files


Press "Preview" to see how the form looks like
