How do they work?
=================

Macros consist of **actions**. Thy allow you do run several actions 
on a specific or selection of tickets.

Macros can be restricted by groups to allow specific actions for specific user 
groups. In some situations macros might be the wrong choice, 
see :doc:`/manage/macros/limitations` for more information.

Actions
-------

When creating a macro, define your desired actions:

  .. figure:: /images/manage/macros/

A macro can do the following things:

* Modify the ticket
   *e.g.,* Escalate its priority, close it, reassign it, rename it, add tags, etc.
* add internal or public notes to the ticket
   This allows you to help your agents with specific information if needed. 
   (e.g. automated changes a trigger applied to the ticket)
* manipulate stay on tab behavior 
   (if applicable in scope)
