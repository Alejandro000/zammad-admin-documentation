Limitations
===========

As of now Zammad does not support variable usage or customer communication 
beside of notes. 

Macros can't update tickets that have required but empty objects.

Stay on tab manipulation (e.g. close a tab upon macro run) is limited to 
running a single macro within a specific ticket. It does not work when 
running macros via an overview.
