Email Notification
   This option is **not available on Microsoft365 channels**.

   To configure the outgoing mail provider for system notifications,
   use a :doc:`regular email notification channel </channels/email/accounts>`.
   (Self-hosted installations only.)

   .. note:: ðŸ¤” **Why?**

      Using a Microsoft account for automated, outgoing messages is risky:
      users who exceed Microsoftâ€™s `email sending limits
      <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#receiving-and-sending-limits>`_
      can have their accounts suspended.
